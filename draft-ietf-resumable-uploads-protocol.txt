1.  Introduction

   HTTP already provides resumable downloads using the "Range" header.
   However, on its own HTTP does not contain a standardized mechanism
   for resumable uploads.  This has lead to a situation where many web
   services implement a proprietary solution for handling connection
   issues during file uploads.  Such a scattered landscape makes it
   impossible to develop clients with resumable upload capabilities in a
   generic approach without focusing on specific, proprietary solutions.
   It also limits the benefits of resumable uploads to web services that
   can free up the resources to implement this.

   Resuming a previously interrupted upload continues the data transfer
   where it left off, without the need to transfer the first part again.
   This capability is especially important in applications handling
   large files or operating in areas with unreliable network
   infrastructure.  Upload interruptions can occur voluntarily, i.e. the
   end-user wants to pause the upload, or involuntarily, i.e. the
   network connection drops.

   This protocol specifies an approach for clients and servers to
   implement resumable uploads on top of HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, allowing
   the reuse of existing infrastructure.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Upload Procedure

   In order to initiate a resumable upload, the client MUST send a
   "POST" request to a known upload URL, under which endpoint the server
   supports resumable uploads as laid out in this document.  Possible
   approaches for the client to obtain this upload URL as presented in
   the section Service Discovery.

   TODO: Request details

4.  Service Discovery

   TODO Discovery using the "Alt-Svc" header and/or "HTTPSSVC" DNS
   record

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
