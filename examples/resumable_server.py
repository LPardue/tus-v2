Created by Jiten Mehta on 10/22/2020.

An example server to aid in developing resumable uploads.

Directory structure:
	This server expects a folder named uploads to exist at the location
	where this script is invoked.

File nomenclature:
	- The server prepends the files with the client_token
	  Eg - 08932499-0570-4BD5-815D-1992F5F5C031_file

	- When the upload is complete, the server simply adds a '.completion' at
	  the end of the file indicating that the file has been uploaded to
	  completion

Running the server:
	To run the server:
	1. Set the environment variable $ export FLASK_APP=resumable_server.py
	2. $ python -m flask run

	Tip - If you want to change the ip address to a static ip, you can specify
	the --host and --port flag when invoking flask run

The HEAD verb is used to get the resumable offset of the file.
This server checks the uploads directory to find any files that have
this client token and are not prepended with '.completed'

POST is used to receiving files with a new token. If a token is reused, this
server currently deletes the old file and simply creates a new one using
the same token

The client sends a PATCH request when it wants to append data to an existing
file. This function does not delete the old file but opens it in append mode 
and adds bytes to the existing file
